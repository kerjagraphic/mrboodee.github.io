	<description>Mr. Boodee&#039;s collection is a collection made with all of his heart, not only selling tokens but characters that have a history for the creator. This character is taken from a real person named Budi, Budi is someone who has a slightly stubborn behavior, he is a drunkard hang out with people who are much younger than him and throughout his life has a life story that is not interesting but funny to tell. This collection is a collection with a very limited number, which ends up mint at only 200 items. Having one Mr. Boodee item means that you are one of the people who have a limited Mr. Boodee item. The policy direction or rules for the sale of Mr. Boodee&#039;s collection will remain consistent until the end unless changes are made on the basis of what is in the best interests of all holders.</description>
